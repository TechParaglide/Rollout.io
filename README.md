## Distributed System Architecture

The core of Rollout.io is built on a highly scalable, fault-tolerant microservices architecture pattern, orchestrated via Docker and Spring Cloud. 

<div align="center">
  <img src="ASSETS/Component_System%20Design.png" alt="Rollout.io System Design" width="100%">
</div>

The ecosystem comprises the following internal microservices and infrastructure components:
* **API Gateway (`port 80`)**: The central entry point handling rate limiting, CORS, and routing traffic to appropriate downstream microservices.
* **Service Registry (Eureka, `port 5000`)**: Handles dynamic service discovery and registration for all internal microservices.
* **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management across all environments, utilizing RabbitMQ message bus for real-time configuration propagation.
* **Auth Service**: Manages security, token validation, and access control.
* **Control Plane Service**: The administrative backend handling the business logic for feature flag creation, modification, and user targeting.
* **SDK Service**: A highly optimized, read-heavy API utilizing Redis caching to serve ultra-low latency flag evaluations to client SDKs.
* **Monitoring & Observability (`port 5001`)**: Integrated Prometheus and Grafana stack for real-time telemetry, metric aggregation, and system health monitoring.

<br/>

</div>

<br/>

### Zero-Trust Context Isolation Pattern
Rollout.io implements a **Zero-Trust System Design** where the `Jwt` token serves as an immutable context boundary directly in the service layer. Rather than treating the token merely as an edge-validation mechanism at the Gateway, identity is directly extracted and enforced inside downstream microservices and repositories (e.g., `findByIdAndCreatedByUid`).
* This eliminates the risk of Insecure Direct Object Reference (**IDOR**) vulnerabilities out-of-the-box.
* Removes repetitive ownership validation logic (`if (entity.getUserId().equals(currentUserId))`).
* Prevents spoofing via client payloads by relying entirely on the security context for identity evaluation.

For a deeper dive into the theoretical foundation and trade-offs of this design pattern, read the complete engineering article: **[Zero-Trust System Design: How We Used JWT as an Immutable Context Boundary in Spring Boot](https://medium.com/@myself.parthsinh/zero-trust-system-design-how-we-used-jwt-as-an-immutable-context-boundary-in-spring-boot-42924aae086f)**.

  <img src="ASSETS/zero_trust_flow.svg" alt="Rollout.io Zero-Trust Identity Context Propagation Flow" width="100%">
</div>


### Event-Driven Cascading Deletion
Rollout.io implements an asynchronous, event-driven cascade deletion pipeline using RabbitMQ to guarantee database integrity. When a developer deletes their account, the downstream deletion executes in a non-blocking sequence:
1. **User Deletion Event**: The Auth Service deletes the user record and publishes a UserDeletedEvent to RabbitMQ.
2. **Project Cleanup**: The Control Plane Service consumes this event, queries all projects owned by the user, publishes a ProjectDeletedEvent for each, and deletes the projects.
3. **Environment Cleanup**: The service consumes the project events, identifies nested environments, publishes an EnvironmentDeletedEvent for each, and deletes the environments.
4. **Flag and Audit Log Purge**: The service consumes the environment events, executing the terminal deletion of all associated flags, rules, and audit logs.

<div align="center">
  <img src="ASSETS/cascading_deletion_flow.svg" alt="Rollout.io Event-Driven Cascading Deletion Flow" width="100%">
</div>

### Security Email Notifications
Rollout.io implements a fully asynchronous security email notification system using **Resend SMTP**:
* **Sign-In & Sign-Out Alerts**: Non-blocking HTML alerts dispatched instantly via Spring Boot's `@Async` scheduler.
* **Proxy-Aware Geolocation**: Traverses GCP `X-Forwarded-For` load balancer headers to resolve client IP and maps geographic locations dynamically.

### Centralized Configuration Server
All microservices in the Rollout.io ecosystem decouple their environment properties and secrets using Spring Cloud Config Server. At boot time:
* Microservices bootstrap by requesting configurations from the central Config Server (port 4998).
* The Config Server dynamically clones and serves properties from an external, secure Git repository (Rollout.io-External-Config.git).
* Any run-time configuration updates are broadcasted across the microservices ecosystem asynchronously using the RabbitMQ message broker.

<div align="center">
  <img src="ASSETS/config_server_flow.svg" alt="Rollout.io Centralized Configuration Server Lifecycle" width="100%">
</div>

### Consistent Hashing & Percentage Rollout Resolution
To deliver deterministic user-level percentage rollouts (e.g., serving a beta feature to 25% of users) without storing state on the server or sync bottlenecks, Rollout.io uses a math-based distribution model.
* **Deterministic Distribution**: We hash the combination of the `userId` and the unique `flagKey` using **MurmurHash3 (32-bit)**. 
* **State-Free Bucketing**: Modulo division of the hash value by `100` yields a bucket index between `0` and `99`. A user is served the enabled variation if their bucket index is less than the configured rollout threshold.
* **Consistency Guaranteed**: A user with a specific ID always lands in the exact same bucket for a given flag across multiple sessions, devices, and service reboots.

<div align="center">
  <img src="ASSETS/hashing_rollout.svg" alt="Rollout.io Consistent Hashing and Percentage Rollout Algorithm" width="100%">
</div>

### Runtime Contextual Targeting Rules
To enable precise segmentation (such as releasing features only to internal QA emails, users in India, or mobile devices) without network latency, Rollout.io resolves rules dynamically on the client side:
* **Context Payload**: The Client SDK supplies a runtime map of user attributes (e.g., `email`, `country`, `device`) when evaluating flags.
* **In-Memory Operators**: The SDK service processes the configuration rules downloaded during synchronization, validating the context map against logical operators (`EQUALS`, `CONTAINS`, `GT`, `LT`, etc.) in-memory.
* **Deterministic Segmentation**: If the context satisfies the condition rules, the targeted variation is enabled instantly with zero additional network overhead.

<div align="center">
  <img src="ASSETS/runtime_targeting_flow.svg" alt="Rollout.io Runtime Targeting Rule Resolution Flow" width="100%">
</div>

### Dynamic Flag Dependency Resolution
Rollout.io implements a strict graph-based prerequisite validation pipeline governed by structural system constraints:
* **Core Flags vs. Dependent Flags**: 
  * **Core Flags** represent standard independent toggles and cannot specify any prerequisite dependencies.
  * **Dependent Flags** can define logical conditions targeting other Core Flags or runtime user attributes (`RuleNode` segments) via `AND` / `OR` gateways.
* **Strict Depth Boundary (Max Depth = 1)**: Dependent flags can **only** depend directly on Core Flags. Nesting dependent flags inside other dependent flags (Dependent-to-Dependent chaining) is strictly prohibited at the database schema layer. This eliminates circular dependency risks and ensures instantaneous, deterministic traversal.

For comprehensive API documentation and interactive testing, the centralized API Gateway includes built-in Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.

Additionally, a pre-configured Postman collection file is available to easily test API calls directly:
* **[Rollout.io Postman Collection](DEPLOY/Rollout.io%20-%20Rest%20-%20v5.0.1.postman_collection.json)**

To view the interface and test endpoints directly:
* **Local Development**: Start the infrastructure and navigate to **[http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80)**
* **Live Production**: Navigate directly to **[http://rollout.paraglide.in/gateway/](http://rollout.paraglide.in/gateway/)** (Swagger UI documentation endpoint)

<div align="center">
  <img src="ASSETS/apigateway.png" alt="API Gateway Documentation Interface" width="100%">
</div>

## Service Registry & Discovery with Netflix Eureka

To support dynamic scaling, load balancing, and zero-downtime routing, all microservices in the Rollout.io ecosystem register themselves with the centralized **Netflix Eureka Service Registry** (operating on port `5000` / `/registry/` path).

* **Dynamic Service Mapping**: Microservices locate each other dynamically via service names instead of static IP addresses, facilitating seamless container orchestration.
* **Heartbeat & Health Monitoring**: Eureka tracks active heartbeats of all active instances, enabling Spring Cloud Gateway to route client traffic exclusively to healthy nodes.

<div align="center">
  <img src="ASSETS/eureka.png" alt="Netflix Eureka Service Registry Dashboard" width="100%">
</div>

## Telemetry & Metrics Monitoring with Grafana

Rollout.io includes a pre-configured Prometheus and Grafana telemetry stack for real-time microservices performance and health monitoring.

To configure and view the dashboard:
1. Navigate to the monitoring interface (by default on port `5001` or as configured).
2. Head over to the **Service Monitoring** section in the sidebar.
3. Connect your **Prometheus** instance as the target data source to fetch real-time telemetry.
4. Import the **Spring APM Dashboard** to visualize CPU, memory, and API request performance.
5. Create and configure the **datasource variable** to ensure dynamic mapping of Spring Boot metrics across the microservices ecosystem.

</div>

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
Make sure your system meets the minimum requirements and has the necessary dependencies installed:
* **System Memory**: Recommended minimum of **8 GB RAM** (16 GB preferred) due to running multiple Spring Boot microservices, databases, and message brokers concurrently.
* **Docker & Docker Compose** (Desktop/CLI)
* **Node.js** (v18.x or above)
* **Java SDK** (v17 or above)
* **Maven** (v3.8+)

### 1. Initialize the Ecosystem via Docker Compose

The complete Rollout.io ecosystem—including microservices, front-end portals, support databases, and monitoring telemetry—is containerized and orchestrated using Docker Compose.

To boot the entire architecture:

```bash
cd DEPLOY
docker-compose up -d
```

*Note: Due to the sequential startup dependencies inside the microservices topology, the orchestration uses delayed container initialization to ensure RabbitMQ and the Eureka Service Registry are fully operational before dependent services boot. The initial startup sequence may require 2 to 3 minutes to complete.*

To monitor the startup state and verify active containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

Once the stack is operational, the integrated Nginx edge proxy serves all components on port 80, replicating the production environment structure locally:

* **Launch Website**: **[http://localhost](http://localhost)**
* **Admin Control Plane**: **[http://localhost/app/](http://localhost/app/)**
* **Test Environment (Zomato Clone)**: **[http://localhost/test/](http://localhost/test/)**
* **API Gateway and Swagger Docs**: **[http://localhost/gateway/](http://localhost/gateway/)**
* **Service Registry (Eureka)**: **[http://localhost/registry/](http://localhost/registry/)**
* **Grafana Dashboard**: **[http://localhost/grafana/](http://localhost/grafana/)**

---

### Local Development Options

If you wish to run individual front-end components in development mode (e.g., for making live code changes) instead of using the pre-built containerized versions, you can shut down the respective containers in Docker and run the local development servers using the steps below.

### 2. Configure and Execute the Admin Control Plane (UI)
The Admin Dashboard requires Firebase Authentication for secure identity management. 

**Authentication Setup:**
Navigate to `UI/src/firebase.js` and inject your Firebase project configuration parameters:
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};
```

**Bootstrapping the UI Server:**
```bash
cd UI
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Execute the Integration Test Environment (Zomato Clone)
To validate the Rollout.io SDK integration and observe real-time feature flagging, boot the pre-configured sample test application.

```bash
cd TEST/zomato-clone
npm install
npm start
```

## Supported Client SDKs

**JavaScript SDK (`@rollout.io/sdk-js`)**
Professional-grade, high-performance SDK designed for web-based rendering environments (Browser & Node.js).

Install the SDK via npm:
```bash
npm install "@rollout.io/sdk-js@latest"
```

**Usage Example:**
```javascript
import sdk from '@rollout.io/sdk-js';

// Initialize the SDK
await sdk.init({
  sdkKey: "YOUR_SDK_KEY",
  userId: "user-unique-id",
  baseUrl: "http://rollout.paraglide.in/gateway" // Live Production Gateway (or "http://localhost:80/gateway" for local)
});

// Evaluate flag value instantly (Fallback value is false)
const isFeatureEnabled = sdk.getFlag("zomato-dark-mode", false);

if (isFeatureEnabled) {
  // Execute feature specific logic
  console.log("Dark mode feature is active.");
}
```

Detailed implementation schematics available at: `SDK/javascript/README.md`

**Java SDK (`com.github.TechParaglide.Rollout.io:sdk-java`)**
Enterprise-grade SDK built utilizing native `HttpClient` for server-side Java and Spring Boot runtimes.

Since the Java SDK is distributed via JitPack, you must include the repository in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

Then, add the dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.TechParaglide</groupId>
    <artifactId>Rollout.io</artifactId>
    <version>5.0.5</version>
</dependency>
```

**Usage Example:**
```java
import com.rollout.io.sdk.RolloutClient;
import com.rollout.io.sdk.RolloutConfig;

// Initialize the SDK
RolloutClient client = new RolloutClient();
RolloutConfig config = new RolloutConfig(
    "YOUR_SDK_KEY",
    "user-unique-id",
    "http://rollout.paraglide.in/gateway" // Live Production Gateway (or "http://localhost:80/gateway" for local)
);

client.init(config);

// Evaluate flag value instantly (Fallback value is false)
boolean isNewCheckoutEnabled = client.getFlag("new-checkout", false);

if (isNewCheckoutEnabled) {
    // Execute feature specific logic
    System.out.println("Checkout feature is active.");
}
```

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

To document the technical direction and engineering trade-offs made during development, the following architectural decisions were established:

### ADR-001: Document-Oriented Storage (MongoDB) for Dynamic Rule Trees
* **Context**: Feature flags range from simple booleans to highly nested rules involving complex prerequisite flag dependency trees (represented as recursive `RuleNode` structures). Relational schemas would require extensive joins, recursive queries, or object-relational mapping overhead.
* **Decision**: Adopt **MongoDB** as the primary datastore for the Control Plane and SDK services.
* **Consequences**: Enables schema flexibility for complex targeting rules (JSON values, multi-operator rules) and direct storage of recursive graphs. Leveraging MongoDB Change Streams also allows real-time UI synchronization via WebSockets.

### ADR-002: Zero-Trust Identity Context Propagation
* **Context**: Standard gateway routing often authenticates requests at the edge and forwards identity via plain custom headers (e.g., `X-User-ID`), creating a vulnerability vector where downstream services might accept spoofed headers.
* **Decision**: Forward the raw **JWT token** downstream and parse/validate user context directly inside the microservices, binding identity directly to DB operations (e.g., `findByIdAndCreatedByUid`).
* **Consequences**: Effectively eliminates IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerabilities, ensuring services remain secure even if internal network isolation is breached.

### ADR-003: Double-Buffered Low-Latency Cache (Redis + MongoDB)
* **Context**: Client SDK flag evaluation requires sub-5ms response times. Direct database reads under high concurrent traffic would cause service degradation.
* **Decision**: Implement a read-heavy **Redis cache** layer in front of the SDK service, using background scheduler syncs alongside transactional cache evictions.
* **Consequences**: Evaluation latency is reduced to `<3ms` for cache hits. If Redis is unavailable, the SDK service gracefully falls back to MongoDB, ensuring high availability with slightly higher latency.

### ADR-004: Asynchronous Deletion Cascades via RabbitMQ
* **Context**: Deleting a primary resource (e.g., user account or project) requires cleaning up environments, feature flags, dependency trees, and audit logs. Synchronous API cascades introduce tight coupling and risk partial failures.
* **Decision**: Execute all downstream cleanup operations asynchronously using **RabbitMQ topic exchanges** with consumer-based retry queues.
* **Consequences**: Guarantees eventual consistency across service boundaries, keeps UI delete actions fast and non-blocking, and prevents orphaned records.

## Future Scope / Roadmap

While the core ecosystem is complete and fully functional, future enhancements could include:
* **Additional SDKs**: Development of native Python, GoLang, and .NET client SDKs.
* **Advanced Analytics**: Built-in A/B testing analytics and conversion tracking based on flag evaluations.
* **Kubernetes Orchestration**: Official Helm charts for scalable Kubernetes cluster deployments.
* **Webhooks & CI/CD Integrations**: Automated flag toggles triggered by external GitHub Actions or CI/CD pipelines.

## Academic Context & Project Documentation

This system was architected and developed as a Final Year Project by scholars of the **Information Technology Department** at **Government Engineering College, Gandhinagar**.

* **Project Report:** The complete engineering project report, including microservices topology, sequence flows, and system designs is available at **[Rollout.io - Project Report.pdf](REPORT/Rollout.io%20-%20Project%20Report.pdf)**.
